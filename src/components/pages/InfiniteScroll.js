// and a number of 'case' statements in the 'switch' to handle all of the different types that we can see.
// Our two cases will be:
// 1. Start loading when the user clicks the loading button ('start');

  // 4 Things we need to keep track of. It's the perfect case to use 'useReducer',
  // rather than keeping track of this state individually (because when the user clicks the button,
  // someimes we're going to have to update 3 or 4 of these items at the same time,
  // so instead of calling different 'setState' functions, we can just, instead, disaptch an event that we're loading data;
  // and the reducer that we build here will keep track of managing all of these different state properties):

  // 1. Loading
  // 2. Is there 'more' data to load? (after the 25 elements, for example)
  // 3. Where we're at in terms of loading data, i.e. after the first 10, then load the next ten (10-20), etc.
  // 4. Data (in state)

  // Load the data into state (in our case, it's just dummy data).
  // Slice the data - grab the elements from 0 to 10 ('perPage').
  // i.e. grab the first 10 elements from the array and put it in some state --> [data].
  // Then map that out down below in the <li>.

  // const [data] = React.useState(allData.slice(0, perPage));

  // Reducer
  // The 'useReducer' hook takes two arguemnts:
  // 1. the reducer itself - this is a function that gets called every time an event is dispatched,
  // and it has a goal of taking the old state, along with the event that occurred, and create a new version of the state;
  // 2. the initial state that we want to have

  // This function returns the current 'state' (our data) and a function that you can call, called 'dispatch'.
  // 'disaptch' allows you to dispatch an event to the reducer so that it produces a new version of the state.
  // See 'reducer' function created above --> 'const reducer = '...

  // Using 'useReducer' to keep track of nested state, where we're updating four properties (so there's no longer a need to use Redux).
  // And these properties are updated all at the same time, in a lot of cases.
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, {
    loading: false, // start with 'false'
    more: true, // 'true' because we assume there's more to load
    data: [],
    after: 0, // the furthest we've gotten in terms of loading data so far (typically, this is the last ID from the data we've loaded, i.e. "get me the next 10 after this ID")

                      the rapid spread of the coronavirus, governors across the

                      week to shut down their states this week so their
                      residents won’t get mad at them.
